You play a stationary character, Cowboy Jim, at the center of the town crossroads. You hold two revolvers, which Marianne can reload, but not shoot, for you. 

The right revolver is controlled with the arrow keys, and the left with wasd. You have an unlimited supply of ammo, but each revolver only holds 6 bullets at a time. Reload early or interrupt a reload by pressing 'e' or '/' respectively. You can shoot both guns at the same time, in any direction. 

Difficulty increments according to how many enemies you kill. Every ten enemies you kill increases the rate of enemies. For every fifty enemies, the rate of enemies decreases, but their speed increases. Succesfull double shots (double-shots that kill two enemies) give you double points, but only increase difficulty as if they were standard kills.

The real skills in the game are
- twitch response
- not losing your head under suddenly-stressful situations
- ammo awareness and pre-planning
