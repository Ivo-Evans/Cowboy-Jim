### Backstory ###
You are at the center of the town square. After a sordid, sexual affair with a two-bit but beautiful whore named Marianne, the ninjas from the east have finally come to get you. She staggers around, drunk by the fountain. She won't be able to shoot for shit, but she can reload a man's gun. Her pail, milky skin stands out against her black hair and against her vivid red, flowered dress, bought for her by the Eastern patron who she then rejected.

She isn't really worth saving, this Marianne. She is a drunkard and she just likes to have fun. You always thought that dying for women was a young man's game. But here you are, at 45, taking a principled stand. You will protect her till the last breath, because you feel there is nothing else for you in this world, not since you lost your wife. You may as well go down, guns a blazing, taking down ninjas as you go...

### instructions ###
You play a stationary character, Cowboy Jim, at the center of the town crossroads. You hold two revolvers, which Marianne can reload, but not shoot, for you. 

The right revolver is controlled with the arrow keys, and the left with wasd. You have an unlimited supply of ammo, but each revolver only holds 6 bullets at a time. Reload early by pressing 'e' for the left gun and '/' for the right gun. You can shoot both guns at the same time, in any direction. 

Difficulty increments according to how many enemies you kill. Every ten enemies you kill increases the rate of enemies slightly. For every fifty enemies you kill, the rate of enemies decreases slightly, but their speed increases slightly. Succesfull double shots (which kill two enemies) give you double points, but only increase difficulty as if they were standard kills, so there is good reason to try for double shots.

The real skills in the game are
- twitch response
- not losing your head under suddenly-stressful situations
- ammo awareness
